Andrew Morris is a data scientist with expertise in statistical analysis, data visualization, and large-scale dataset management. Currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oslo's Centre for Precision Psychiatry, he analyzes complex datasets from Norwegian health registries, combining genetic data with electronic health records to develop predictive models for disease onset across tens of thousands of subjects.

With a PhD in Biology and extensive experience in quantitative research, Andrew specializes in transforming raw data into actionable insights through advanced statistical modeling and clear visualizations. He is proficient in R for data manipulation (dplyr), statistical analysis, and creating publication-quality graphics with ggplot2, along with foundational SQL skills for database queries and data extraction.

Andrew's work spans diverse domains including precision medicine, aquaculture systems, and environmental science, where he has successfully collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to translate complex analytical findings for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. His research has contributed to securing over $3 million in funding and has been published in high-impact journals including Nature Microbiology.

He brings a unique combination of rigorous analytical skills, domain expertise in biological systems, and a passion for data-driven decision making. Andrew is currently seeking opportunities as a Data Engineer, Data Scientist, or Data Analyst where he can apply his technical skills to solve real-world business challenges and support data-informed strategies.
