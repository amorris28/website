Andrew Morris is a postdoc in the Centre for Bioinformatics at the University
of Oslo and a member of the Precision Psychiatry group (formerly NORMENT) at
the Oslo University Hospital. His current work focuses on using health registry
data and genotype data to model age of diagnosis in prostate cancer and other
heritable cancers. This work has applications in precision medicine and
has the potential to improve early screening and diagnosis for improved
outcomes for heritable diseases.

Andrew was formerly a postdoc at the University of Oregon where he studied
the heritability of the microbiome in plants and animals. He was awarded his 
PhD from the University of Oregon in 2022 where he worked with Brendan Bohannan. 
In his dissertation research, Andrew wanted to understand how variation in
the composition of microorganisms in an ecosystem influence variation in
ecosystem function. He was specifically interested in how land-use change could
modify soil greenhouse gas emissions mediated by the microbiome in diverse
ecosystems of central Africa and the Brazilian Amazon.

Andrew has broad expertise in environmental and life sciences. He specializes
in statistical genetics and multivariate analysis of deep sequencing data,
such as microbiome marker gene and metagenomic sequencing. He also has a 
background in biodiversity assessment and community ecology. His work draws
on tools from quantitative genetics and experimental approaches from 
evolutionary biology.
