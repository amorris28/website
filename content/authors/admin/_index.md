Andrew Morris is a data scientist with expertise in advanced statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and data visualization. Currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oslo’s Centre for Precision Psychiatry, he develops models using large-scale health registry and genetic data to predict disease onset across tens of thousands of individuals.

With a PhD in Biology and extensive experience in quantitative research, Andrew specializes in turning complex, high-dimensional datasets into actionable insights. He is proficient in R and Python for data wrangling, machine learning, and visualization, complemented by SQL for data extraction and management.

His work spans healthcare, aquaculture, and environmental science, where he has collaborated across disciplines to inform both research and real-world decision-making. His research has contributed to securing over $3M in funding and has been published in high-impact journals, including Nature Microbiology.

Andrew brings a rare combination of rigorous analytical skills, domain expertise in biological systems, and a passion for applying data science to practical challenges. He is seeking opportunities as a Data Scientist or Applied Data Scientist, with openness to Analyst roles in healthcare, agriculture, and environmental domains.
