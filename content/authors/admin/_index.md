Andrew Morris earned his PhD from the University of Oregon where he worked in
the [Bohannan Lab](https://bohannanlab.org). He is an ecosystem and community
ecologist who has studied carbon and nitrogen cycling in diverse ecosystems
including periglacial ecosystems in Alaska and Peru; corn fields and rice
paddies in New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware; and tropical forests in Brazil
and Gabon. His current research is connecting microbial ecology and community
ecology to ecosystem nutrient cycles. He wants to understand how the
composition and abundance of microorganisms in an ecosystem influence the rate
of ecosystem-scale functions. He addresses this problem by drawing on
statistical tools from quantitative genetics and experimental approaches from
evolutionary biology. 

Andrew is currently seeking academic and industry positions in ecology, bioinformatics, and data science.
