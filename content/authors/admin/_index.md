Andrew Morris earned his PhD from the University of Oregon in 2022 where he
worked in the [Bohannan Lab](https://bohannanlab.org). He is a microbiome
scientist and bioinformatician who has studied the role of the microbiome in
ecosystem functioning. His current research focuses on the heritability of the
microbiome in humans and animals to understand microbiome-mediated traits.  He
wants to discover how the composition and abundance of microorganisms in an
ecosystem influence ecosystem traits. He addresses this problem by drawing on
statistical tools from quantitative genetics and experimental approaches from
evolutionary biology. 

Andrew is currently seeking industry positions in microbiome science,
bioinformatics, and data science.
