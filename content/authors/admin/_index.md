Andrew Morris is a graduate student at the University of Oregon in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution and the Department of Biology. His research is connecting microbial ecology and community ecology to ecosystem nutrient cycles. He wants to understand how the composition and abundance of microorganisms in an ecosystem contribute to the rate of ecosystem-scale functions. He also wants to find ways to make microbial data, including marker gene and metagenomic sequences, useful for predicting, modeling, and managing ecosystem functions such as greenhouses gas emissions.
