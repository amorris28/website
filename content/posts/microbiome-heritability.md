## Summary

This paper compiles and analyses published estimates of microbiome heritability across plant and animal hosts. We argue that many mechanisms could contribute to a pattern of heritability including direct and indirect mechanisms (i.e., G-E covariances). And we show that current estimates are limited to a narrow range of hosts. This paper highlights the need for more standardized methods to better understand how microbiomes could respond to selection.
